# The YAM Super.Site and Articles

As a complement to the YAM Replanted work done for the YAM Re-Org, https://yam.super.site is a website that presents the ideas in a more concise and readable form, distilling and editing the information down into chunks that anyone can follow and understand. The website contains 7 articles; 4 on the ideas and strategies of the Re-Org and 3 on some of the specific elements that are being implemented.

## Silos Section

The [Silos section](https://yam.super.site/silos) of the site is a proof of concept for a space where silos can present their work to the YAM community and general public. As you may have noticed, this section of the site overlaps in scope with the YAM Open File System and Information Repository site (Where you are most likely reading this). Which tools to use and what scope falls under which site is still an open question that is being discussed.

## Details

The yam.super.site website was built using [Notion](https://notion.so) as the Content Management Service and was created using [Super](https://super.so/). The Design and site were made as part of the YAM Design Studio Grant and the Articles were written as part of the YAM Re-Org Grant.
