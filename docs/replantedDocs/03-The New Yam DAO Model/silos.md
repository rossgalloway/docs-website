# Silos

## What Are Silos?

Silos a collection of work or projects that token holders believe add value to YAM and group together to help organize them.

Silos are similar to a “department” or the prior “guilds” in that they groups certain people, entities, and ideas together so that they can be considered and reasoned about together. Examples of this would be a B*randing and Design* *silo,* or a *Governance Contract Upgrade Silo,* or a *Yam Reorg Silo.* These are convenient grouping that we can use to categorize work and fund that work through *grants* (described in the next section).

While these silos may be helpful for understanding how funds are being spent, they are not entities that receive funding and employ contributors directly. They help the DAO define a direction in that each silo may have a purpose and goals that are to be worked toward, and will fund grants to fulfill those goals. Silos have no defined duration and can be created and retired as needed, merged or split apart as is deemed most useful to collaborate.

## Creating a Silo

Creating a silo is an informal process that will typically occur when creating the initial grant that will live within that silo. A contributor would propose to do so in order to help token holders better understand the context of work that they wish to do and help them explain the grants that will apply for. Included in that initial grant would be a scope of work to create a new Silo page within the YAM notion and public pages.

Upon approval of the grant and silo, a user can be added as a guest contributor to the relevant YAM notion pages in order to complete this work. Who has admin controls over the YAM notion pages will be discussed in later sections.
