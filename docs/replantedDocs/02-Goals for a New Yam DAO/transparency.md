ðŸ’¡ Where and How much?

## The Value of Transparency

Transparency is incredibly important to the success of a DAO because it is the tool used to assure accountability.  In order for accountability to work, there must be sufficient transparency between those who are requesting and paying for work to be done, and those who are performing the work. This does not need to be continuous transparency (i.e. working entirely in public), but there does need to be enough intermittent transparency so that the work can be assessed. Think of the difference between your boss looking over your shoulder as you work and them asking to see your progress at the end of the week.

Transparency is especially important when token holders are expected to hold contributors accountable for the work that they have said they will do. If this is a goal of the organization then work must be performed in a way that provides enough information for the token holders to make educated decisions about the quality of work. This also applies to having enough information to know what to expect from contributors in the future via well specified goals. Even if all work is done in public, if those who are tasked with assuring accountability donâ€™t know what to expect from contributors then that transparency is not useful.
