# YAM Re-Org 

This project aims to build a new framework for the YAM DAO to facilitate better transparency, accountability, and permissionless-ness. It does so by developing a new process by which projects can receive funding.

It will clarify the governance process, define and limit the roles of core contributors, and provide an example structure for how funded projects can be run.

The Goals of this project are to upgrade the structure of YAM for the better. We have watched as the DAO has struggled to find its purpose and has struggled to retain mindshare and contributors. We believe that the causes of this are multi-faceted, including a lack of vision around the mission of the DAO, a lack of thought and investment in the core organizational infrastructure of the DAO, an inability to enforce accountability, and confusion around management of projects.

Solving these problems is a large task to undertake and measuring success will require long term tracking. The scope of this grant proposal is to design and implement the first stages of this process to show a proof of concept, as well as educate the wider community about the changes that we are making.
