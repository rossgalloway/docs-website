# The YAM Open File System

:::note

This is an ongoing project and this file may change.

:::

The website that you are currently viewing this document on is in many ways the deliverable. I hope it is working well. if it is, you should be able to review different project silos and their documents. It should also allow contributors and grant recipients to submit pull requests to create new project directories.

## File Structure

Below is the current project directory structure for Silo Projects:

```
Project Directory (This is your github repo)
   |
   ├── readme.md (marketing doc or executive summary)
   |
   ├── Specification doc.md
   |
   ├── Grant-001 Folder
   │   ├── Grant Application
   │   ├── Payment request 1      
   │   ├── Payment request 2
   │   └── ...
   │
   ├── Grant-002 Folder
   │   ├── Grant Application
   │   ├── Payment request 1      
   │   ├── Payment request 2
   │   └── ... 
   │
   ├── Grant-00n Folder
   │   ├── Grant Application
   │   ├── Payment request 1      
   │   ├── Payment request 2
   │   └── ... 
   │
   ├── Deliverables Folder 
   │   ├── subfolders and files as you see fit to represent your deliverables. Could also be the project files.
   │   └── ... 
   │
   └── Other Documents Folder
       ├── images from spec doc, other important files, etc
       └── ... 
```

## Website Code

You can view the website code here: <https://github.com/rossgalloway/docs-website>

This site, once completed and approved, should move to the YAM Github Organization and be stored there.

## Project Silo Github Repositories

Right now all of the Project Silo Repositories live in my personal github account, but the website can read from any github repository. For example, you can see the code [here](https://github.com/rossgalloway/docs-website/blob/6d90489c09397584831ca62eb8d7df8a7e123e3a/docusaurus.config.js#L19) that sets the repository that the documentation section is pulled from.
