# The Project Silo Template

Hi and Welcome! If you are on your journey to start a project funded by YAM then you are in the right spot. This template folder is the starting point for creating your own decentralized project folder on the YAM Github. You can think of this as the DAO's file system where files are stored publicly so that they can be accessed by the community and public. To get started, we recommend cloning this repository and using it as the starting point for your project repo.
