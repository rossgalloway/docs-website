# The Deliverables Folder

Place any deliverables in this folder once they are completed. This folder could also be used as a folder for the project code and documents as they are being worked on.

The file system reads this file as the content for the page when "Deliverables" is clicked on. So you can use it as an intro, readme, etc.
