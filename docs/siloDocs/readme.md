# Getting Started

Welcome to the YAM Information Repository! We are glad you are here. This is your one stop shop to get all the information you need about YAM as a token holder, grant applicant, or interested investor. This repository is open source, all the documents are available on github, and anyone is welcome to contribute by making pull requests.

## Using the Site

You can think of this website as a cross between a documentation site and a community file system. It is built with Docusaurus, and each section at the top☝️ has a separate github repository for the files that live there. [Editor's note: for now these repositories are in my personal github but they will migrate to the YAM Organization repo soon:tm:.] If you want to contribute, it is as simple as making a pull request (repos listed below).

:point_left:On the left is the navigation bar that shows the current information about silos, including their application forms, Specification documents, grant proposals, and payment requests. Deliverables may also be listed for each silo. There is also a template section that applicants we recommend applicants use when applying for their own grants.

## How to Submit a new Grant proposal

If you want to submit a new grant proposal to do work for YAM, you are in the right place. If you are not already familiar with how the system works at a high level, I recommend reading [this article](https://yamdao.notion.site/4-The-New-Yam-DAO-Model-v-0-2-ef947f2ecf9e4b18ab8626801e4955fa) which gives a good overview and also [this article](https://yamdao.notion.site/5-Yam-Grants-An-Overview-v-0-1-c992d2644d214c8984979d94a567ab5b) which goes into more detail about the process. You can also read about the detailed parts of the system in the [deliverables section](/YAM%20Re-Org/Deliverables/YAM%20Replanted%20Docs/03-The%20New%20Yam%20DAO%20Model/An%20Overview.md).

The very high level overview of the process is as follows:

1. You should state your intent to apply for a grant by submitting a [silo application](/Template/silo-app-template.md) by copying the template and forking the `YAM PROJECT SILOS` [repository](https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-Project-Silos), writing your document, and submitting a pull request. Detailed instruction on how to do this are below. Please also post your document to the [YAM governance forum](https://forum.yam.finance/c/grant-silo-proposals/26) for token holders to comment on.

2. Once you have posted your application on the forum, you should receive initial feedback from token holders about whether they support further work on the project. On Github, repo maintainers and the Gov-Ops council will vet your application for completeness and recommend any required formatting changes. 

3. If you recieve positive feedback and with to continue forward, the next step is to produce a Specification Document for your project. A template can be seen [here](/Template/silo-specification-template.md) and you can copy it from the same repository as the application in step 1. This document is what YAM token holders will use to determine whether they approve a grant or not (It is super important!). It should also be posted both to github and the governance forum, and the review process will be similar to the application.

4. After review and revision of the Specification document, it is time to vote. You can submit a proposal to the YAM[snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/yam.eth) if you have 100 YAM in your wallet, or you can ask someone else to do it for you. Votes should be open for at least 3 days and should avoid important holidays.

5. If it passes then it is time to get to work!

## Using Github

If you are not familiar with Github, this section will go over what you need to know to get started. If you want to read more about why we use github for this process, you can read [this blog post](https://rossgalloway.github.io/docs-website/blog/Why).
