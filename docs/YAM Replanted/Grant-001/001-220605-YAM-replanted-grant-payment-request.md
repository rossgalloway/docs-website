# üç† YAM Replanted Grant-001 Payment Request

This document records the work done on the YAM ReOrg silo over the past month for token holders to review and compare to the grant application.

You can see individual compensation requests for @ross and @designer here:
Ross: <https://forum.yam.finance/t/22-06-03-specific-architectures-ross-contributor-compensation-request/1682>
Designer: <https://forum.yam.finance/t/2022-06-03-designers-silo-compensation-report-for-may-2022/1681>

Below are excerpts from those posts showing the work done:

[quote="designer, post:1, topic:1681"]
In May my focus was on ‚Äòmaking it all make sense‚Äô, so to speak. Essentially, the process of taking volumes of reorg information and 1) collaborating to figure out how to present the Yam Reorg in a website structure that is being created by @chilly (working within his own silo), and 2) editing the information and distilling it to the essence of what the Yam Reorg is all about, including the process leading up to, and the conclusions that have defined up to this point ‚Äì all within short and easily readable articles which have links to the details within @Ross‚Äô yam.doc.super.site.

* Article #0 - Introducing Yam Re-Org v.0.1

* Article #1 - What Makes a Good DAO v.0.4

* Article #4 - A New Yam Org Model v.0.1
[Notion ‚Äì The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.](https://yamdao.notion.site/4-The-New-Yam-Org-Model-v-0-1-127f0e82caea4fc681845f74c72c8460)
* Ongoing collaboration with @chilly and @Ross and a variety of problem solving subjects

Note: Article #2, 3 and 4 are the main thrust of work for the month of June. A separate proposal will be submitted in the next few days for that work to occur within the already created Yam Re-Org Silo structure. The Yam Reorg Silo work will likely be ongoing until the new reorg structure is fully defined and in place.

### YAM Reorg

* I have continued to work on refining and developing the YAM re-org design, implementation and documentation and my work this month can be seen in this document: <https://yam-reorg-docs.super.site> under ‚Äúcurrent docs‚Äù. This document is still in draft form and is presented here to show progress. Along with @designer and @chilly I have been refining the structure and content of the information and coordinating with them to distill it down into a shorter, more accessible form.
* Beyond the content of the above report, I have also worked on the formatting and layout of the website in which it is presented. This too is a work in progress and will need to be coordinated with a final presentation state coordinated with @designer and @chilly.
* In practice testing and refinement of some of the processes proposed including going through the process with this project. You can see the application document here: <https://forum.yam.finance/t/yam-reorg-silo-creation-and-may-grant-application/1670>
* I spent a fair amount of time thinking through how the system was working in practice via snake‚Äôs [Yambassador Proposal](https://forum.yam.finance/t/yambassadors-silo/1656) which provided an interesting test case.
* I have written a draft requirements document for the ReOrg here: <https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-rePlanted/blob/master/YAM%20Replanted%20requirements.md>

I am going to write my end of month reaction and discuss what we achieved and what we learned. Here are the stated deliverables from the original post.

[quote="ross, post:1, topic:1670"]
The deliverables that we intend to prepare by June 1st, 2022 are as follows:

* We will go through the full grant process over the next month. This application is the first step.
[/quote]

We did this and also went through the grant process with @Snake which was helpful in understanding what isn't clear and what we need to work on. Building out the standards for documentation around requirements and specifications is going to be very important, and the application form that I created for this process is not sufficient and may give the impression that is all that is needed.

Going through the process also helps us understand where we are relying on the prior mechanisms and handwaving away some of the complexities. Next month, when we do it again we need to use what we have learned and try and get the rest of the team on-board with this new model.

>* We will further refine the work started in the links above that explains the changes, outlines the process, and provides templates and expectations for creating new grant/silo proposals.

@designer has  done a really good job of distilling down the ideas that have been proposed and makes it more easy to understand the why. I will admit that I have not been as successful at outlining the full process and it is something I need to focus more on next month.

>* The work done last month focused on the theory and ideological underpinnings of the changes to the DAO. This month we will focus on refining and documenting the governance structure that is required to make the DAO and grants program run smoothly including:
>   * Specifying and beginning to implement the [Gov-Ops Council](https://yam-reorg-docs.super.site/a9cd0ef351e14e548991a243919cb626).
>   * Documenting the roles for different stakeholders in governance
>   * Begin producing in-depth documentation for different parts of the governance process as proposed.

Progress on understanding the gov-ops council has been slow and I change my mind about how it should work seemingly weekly. I am conflicted about the best way to get solid vetting and quality control for projects while maintaining objectivity and preventing bias. The roles and responsibilities of the gov-ops council needs to be thoroughly thought through and discussed.

Understanding the roles of different stakeholders will help with this and it has been documented [here](https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-rePlanted/blob/master/YAM%20Replanted%20requirements.md) and [here](https://yamdao.notion.site/Goals-of-Re-Org-9f09ded127f24b32a6c7f973a70a801f) (sorry the second link is messy). In the end, this is a question of how much influence token holders want to give to those who vet projects and how much to pay them.

>* Further formulate and develop the secondary elements that are impacted by governance decisions (Treasury yield distribution, potential governance upgrades, etc)

This is something that didn't get a whole bunch of time spent on it, although I did work through some questions about [issuance and compensation](https://forum.yam.finance/t/the-dao-must-mint-more-yam/1680), which are ultimately closely related to the grants system. I hope those posts can stir some conversation and help move this forward.

### Next month

We will put together a proposal for our June work early next week, but I will dive into what I think it will include.
* I would like to focus more on nailing down more of the details around gov-ops and how we vet proposals and give token holders the information that they need.
* In doing that we need to bring the other parties who are not currently working under this model in to test it out. That is really only @ethe and @mona and I think we can work something out.  
* More diagrams!
* I have a plan for a github based document repository for snapshot, on-chain, and grant proposals with a simple static front-end that I want to start playing around with.

I will think about this over the weekend and then get together with @designer to figure out the next steps and put up our proposal for next month's work.

Thanks for reading :heart:
