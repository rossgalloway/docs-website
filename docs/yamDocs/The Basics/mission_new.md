# Yam‚Äôs Mission

![The Mission](/img/Ross__2_explorers_setting_off_to_explore_a_perfect_and_awe_insp_bb46f7d7-2afb-42b7-bbc5-f5b8c821da04.png)

Yam is a token-holder run Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) innovating at the intersection of decentralized governance and programmable finance. It is driven by shared financial incentives with the goal of using the new decentralized financial and cultural primitives available on Ethereum to explore new ways of collaboration, organization, and financial empowerment for its members and the world.

Yam's mission and vision is supported via three guiding pillars:

### Fair and Ethical Operation ‚öñÔ∏è

By the community, for the community. We are an community of do-ers, embracing an open, fair and ethical philosophy. The Yam community fosters an inclusive, energetic and collaborative culture committed to building valuable products and infrastructure that benefits it's members, the broader crypto space, and the world.

### Decentralized On-Chain Governance and Treasury üí∞

Yam is committed to decentralized decision making and ownership, leveraging its community of token holders and contributors to both build and guide the protocol forward. This means that the community decides together how best to invest the treasury and grow the DAO, and their will is executed via an open governance model that doesn't rely on privileged actors or centralized entities.

### Innovation: Funding cutting edge experimentation üî¨

Yam seeks to enable the promise of what [Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/) can become for the world: a global, permissionless digital ecosystem. Think of Yam as a factory dedicated to funding new ideas, innovations, and experiments. Yam is therefore in uncharted waters, guided by its mission and values as a north star.

The Web3 ecosystem is full of organizations that make different trade-offs for decentralization, communal ownership, efficiency, security, and profit. YAM has made a choice to prioritize decentralization, permissionlessness, and communal ownership and refuses to stray from these core values, instead driving confidently forward to show that a new, better world awaits.

### Innovation required. Injustice rejected. Do-ers empowered. üç†
