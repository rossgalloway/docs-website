# Introduction

Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to the Yam Documentation Repository. This is your one stop shop to learn all about what the Yam DAO is and how it works. If there is anything that you can't figure out from the documents below, we encourage you to stop by our [discord](https://forum.yam.finance/) server and ask about it. If you notice anything wrong and want to submit an update to these docs, you can submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/rossgalloway/YAM-documentation/tree/master/new-docs).

## What is YAM?

Yam DAO, commonly just referred to as Yam, is a decentralized organization (a DAO) that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and is contributed to by people around the world. We are a community of Ethereum and Crypto enthusiasts, dreamers, and builders who are trying to build products, tools, and experiences that will push the space forward.  We value decentralization highly and user permissionless governance processes to make decisions and control the DAO treasury.

The DAO has a token, also called YAM, that is used to vote on decisions and to unlock the treasury to spend it. Anyone can buy YAM and participate. If you would like to join, you can buy YAM on Sushiswap.
