# How to Contribute

YAM is an open organization that encourages participation by a broad set of actors. We have built a new token holder governed system for contributions that we hope will allow anyone to add value to the DAO.

There are a few ways to participate in and contribute to the Yam DAO. If you are interested in applying for funding to work on a new or existing project, you would go through the Grants Process. If you are looking to participate in governing the DAO and helping to manage the grants process then you can apply to be a Governance Steward. If you are simply a token holder and don't have time to participate actively, you can delegate your vote to a Governance Steward or another member of the community that you believe will vote and act in your best interests.

### *Grant Recipients* : Creators and Builders

Anyone that wishes to perform some kind of work for Yam must go through the Silo, Grants application process in order to receive funding for a specific project (as defined by a scope of work, deliverables and delivery dates). Grant Recipients function as independent contractors who enjoy the freedom to manage their own projects. They must fulfill the project specifications and deliverables to receive payment. You can read more about grants [here](yam-grants.md) and how to apply [here](the-grants-process.md)

### *Voter/Decision Makers* : Governance Stewards

As stewards of the DAO, token holders control the treasury and decide what projects to fund. Token holders vote to approve Grants based on a detailed project specification documentation. Finally, token holders vote to approve payments for work done by Grant recipients dependent upon the successful delivery of the project. We understand that making these decisions takes research, time, and effort, and the DAO is committed to paying for this work. Read more about becoming a governance steward [here](governance-stewards.md)

### *Passive Holders* : Vote Delegators

If you don't have time to dive into governing YAM, but still want to participate in the DAO, you can delegate your voting weight to a governance steward whose goals and mission you are aligned with. You can see a list of Governance Stewards here [To Be Created] and you can delegate [here](https://yam.finance/governance#/governance)
