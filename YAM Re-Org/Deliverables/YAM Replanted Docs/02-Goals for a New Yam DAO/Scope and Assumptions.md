# Defining our Scope and Assumptions

üí° How do we define success for YAM?

</aside>

## Defining Success

The Re-Org is an update to the organizational structure of YAM. It aims to improve the efficiency and accountability of work done on behalf of the DAO while maintaining its permission-less, decentralized core. Once complete, the Re-Org will provide token holders the foundation to pursue whatever vision of success that they define.

The YAM Re-Org does not and cannot define the vision. In order for YAM to be successful, token holders must first define what success is. Token holders can deploy the DAO treasury as they see fit, but simply doing so will not ensure success. It is just the starting point. Answering why and to what end the DAO should deploy the capital in the treasury is the first step in defining success and it is a question that must ultimately answered by the token holders themselves.

As long time contributors and token holders, we want to see YAM succeed. The purpose of this document, and the goal of YAM Replanted is to create a system that encourages success. There is no single group responsible for ‚Äúmaking YAM successful‚Äù.  The DAO contains different groups with different abilities to impact success and failure, but there is one party that will play an outsized role: Token Holders.

## Foundational Assumptions

While Yam Replanted does not attempt to answer what YAM‚Äôs purpose is, it is opinionated about how it operates. We believe that YAM should continue to operate with the same ethos that it has in the past: A permissionless, decentralized organization that puts fairness and experimentation at the forefront and doesn‚Äôt take shortcuts. We are interested in exploring a system that holds true to these ideals and also functions effectively and accountably.

In doing so, we will make the following assumptions about how the DAO must operate:

- Anyone should be able to freely join and leave the DAO at any time.
- The DAO should not be constrained by a limit to the number of token holders or the number of actors who are able to participate in governance.
- No individual actor or actors should be able to exert control over the DAO outside of the accepted mechanisms (token voting).
- Anyone who wishes to contribute to the DAO can do so and their compensation will be be determined by DAO members (token holders).
- All information necessary to participate in the DAO should be publicly available.

With these constraints set, we can now focus more effectively on the goals that we wish to achieve in this re-organization.
