As a contractor, you have the freedom to run your project as you wish. You are however bound by the terms of the approved Grant which stipulates periodic check points to assure accountability and so that Yam token holders can make sure the project is on track. This is accomplished via monthly Status Reports posted to the Yam Forum, outlining your projects status and any challenges or issues that may have arisen. Silo teams manage their own projects while the Yam community is able to monitor your project and its use of treasury funds.","sidebar":"yamSidebar"},"yamDocs/grants process docs/grants-process/step-5":{"id":"yamDocs/grants process docs/grants-process/step-5","title":"Step 5: Deliver the Work and Request Payment","description":"While project teams have full control of their projects, Silo teams must deliver the work as defined by the terms of the Yam Grant which serves as a contractual agreement.  Based on the terms of the Grant, you\u2019ll either submit payment requests upon delivery of the job, or on a pre-defined cadence such as monthly payments, or by the completion of project phases. Payments are made by the Gov-Ops Council via an approved on-chain vote by Yam token holders. Accountability is achieved because both parties are incentivized to deliver on their side of the bargain.","sidebar":"yamSidebar"},"yamDocs/grants process docs/grants-process/step-6":{"id":"yamDocs/grants process docs/grants-process/step-6","title":"Step 6 - How to Extend or Renew Your Project","description":"Some projects are finite and come to completion when the project or work is delivered and the Grant has been fully paid.
